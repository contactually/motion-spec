Specs are important! This project makes them a first-class citizen again.

RubyMotion is great at integrating them from the start, but
they aren't core to the RubyMotion workflow, and lag behind their distant
`rspec` cousin (RubyMotion's specs are forked from `MacBacon`, which is a port
of `Bacon` which is a simplified version of `rspec`).

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'motion-spec'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install motion-spec
